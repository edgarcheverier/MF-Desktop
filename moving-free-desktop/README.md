Moving Free Desktop is the desktop version of Moving Free App 
An app for for helping people that have the car 5 days a week in the garage paying every month for the parking, insurance and maintenance for using the car maybe 4 days per month, because go everyday to the work with the car is usually in a city expensive and uncomfortable.

The idea of Moving Free is is having a place where you can rent your car to other people when you dont use it, and for the people who wants to rent a car without paying a lot of money.
